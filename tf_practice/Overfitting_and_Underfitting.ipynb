This means thae network has not learned the relevant patterns in the training data.\n",

When that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to use techniques like regularization. These place constraints on the quality and type of information your model can store. If a network cna only affort to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better change of generalizing well.\n",

In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often reffered to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their target, a mapping without any generalization power, but this would be useless when making predictions on previously unseen data.\n",

        "## Add dropout\n",
        "Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks. Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. set to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are begin zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fac that more units are active than at training time."
